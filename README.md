Neither Mutations nor Selective Replacement <br>
Experiment 1: 1 Cooperator, 9 Defectors <br>
For this experiment, we predict that most if not all the organisms will end up as defectors. Because the cooperator is willing to share resources, but no one else is, it will likely not reproduce, which means there will likely be 1 or 0 cooperators at the end of the experiment. We ran Experiment 1 ten times, and the average was 0% cooperation value. This means that for all ten runs, 100% of the populaton was defectors. This outcome supports our prediction.

Experiment 2: 9 Cooperators, 9 Defectors <br>
For this experiment, we predict that most of the organisms will be cooperators at the end. We made this prediction because we feel that with most of the population being cooperators, they will share resources more and reproduce more, whereas the 1 defector might not be able to reproduce as much. We ran experiment 2 ten times, and the average was 100% cooperation value. This outcome backs up our prediction, as all the organisms by the end of the ten runs were cooperators.

Experiment 3: Even number of each group (10 organisms) <br>
For this experiment, we predict that the numbers will remain relatively even, with maybe a slight edge towards defectors. We feel like there just aren't enough cooperators for them to adequately survive and reproduce, which will mean that more reproduction will happen from defectors. We ran experiment 3 ten times, and the average was 15% cooperation value. We might have overpredicted the survivorship of the cooperators, but we had the right idea with our prediction, as we said that there might be a slight edge towards defectors at the end. 

Experiment 4: 1 Cooperator, 99 Defectors <br>
For this experiment, we predict that there will few or even no cooperators by the end of the experiment. There is only 1 cooperator in 100 organisms, so that cooperator will only be giving away energy, and never recieve energy, unless it is able to reproduce, which seems unlikely. We ran experiment 4 ten times, and the average was 0% cooperation value. This result is in-line with our prediction, as the cooperators were never able to benefit from energy sharing, and were thus unable to reproduce and eventually were randomly eliminated due to the reproduction of a defector. 

Experiment 5: 99 Cooperators, 1 Defector <br>
For this experiment, we predict that most if not all the organisms will be cooperators by the end of the experiment. We believe that this will be the case because there will be a lot of energy sharing, which will allow cooperators to stay alive and reproduce more. There is also only 1 defector in 100 organisms, and it is unlikely that 1 organism can reproduce enough to significantly impact the cooperation rate. We rean experiment 5 ten times, and the average was 75% cooperation value. This result is lower than we expected, although still in line with our thinking that that would be mostly cooperators left. 

Experiment 6: Even number of each group (100 organisms)
For this experiment, we predict that there will be some of each group, but that by the end there will be more defectors than the other groups. We think that this will be the case because there are just too many defectors that won't share any energy, and they'll likely reproduce more than the other groups. We ran experiment 6 ten times, and the average was 2.9% cooperation value. This result is much lower than we expected, however we were right about there being more defectors than the other two groups.
